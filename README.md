# CSIS-516-Final-Project
Final Python Project (Social Media Profile Finder App) 

**Description:** The Social Media Profile Finder is a Python app where it takes the input of a first and last name from a user, and the program returns a list of likely social media profile links. While it doesnâ€™t use APIs for live results due to restrictions, it automatically creates likely profile URLs. It will help users locate potential social media profiles all in one app. 

**Purpose:**  The purpose of this program is to make it easier to find potential links to people when searching for them. It will all be in one spot so it is easier to validate. For example, this program could be useful for employers and/or people on online dating apps to have more confirmation that someone is really who they say they are. 

**Value:**  This app values efficiency and convenience for its users. It is meant to reduce the amount of time spent searching for each account individually by putting all of it in one convenient location. This could also be the building block to potentially a later version that includes APIs.

**Technologies used:** For this Python application the technologies used in development from the Python Libraries will be Tkinter for the GUI, and links to open up websites directly through clicking on the link.
