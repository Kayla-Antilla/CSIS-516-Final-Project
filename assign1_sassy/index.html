        <h1>Welcome to the Three Broomsticks!</h1>

            <p>This rustic tavern is the place to go for good food,
            friendly conversation, and of course—a Butterbeer &trade;.
            The cosy, snow-capped inn is the place where Harry Potter &trade;
            had his first taste of the sweet wizarding drink.
            Through the centuries, the Three Broomsticks &trade;
            has welcomed countless Hogwarts &trade; students including
            Harry and his friends. Inside you'll notice details such as
            cast-iron chandeliers, weathered wood beams, and balconies
                brimming with curious bric-a-brac. Take a seat and have your
                fill of tasty British fare including 'The Great Feast',
                Fish And Chips, Shepherd's Pie, Beef Pasties, Turkey Legs,
                and Fresh Vegetables.
