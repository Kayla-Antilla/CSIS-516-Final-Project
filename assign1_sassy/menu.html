<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Three Broomsticks!</h1>
    <p>This rustic tavern is the place to go for good food,
         friendly conversation, and of course—a Butterbeer &trade;.
          The cosy, snow-capped inn is the place where Harry Potter &trade;
          had his first taste of the sweet wizarding drink.
          Through the centuries, the Three Broomsticks &trade;
          has welcomed countless Hogwarts &trade; students including
          Harry and his friends. Inside you'll notice details such as
           cast-iron chandeliers, weathered wood beams, and balconies
            brimming with curious bric-a-brac. Take a seat and have your
             fill of tasty British fare including 'The Great Feast',
             Fish And Chips, Shepherd's Pie, Beef Pasties, Turkey Legs,
             and Fresh Vegetables.
